-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC # Delta Lake
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ## What is it?
-- MAGIC Delta Lake is an open format storage layer that delivers reliability, security and performance on your data lake â€” for both streaming and batch operations.
-- MAGIC By replacing data silos with a single home for structured, semi-structured and unstructured data, Delta Lake is the foundation of a cost-effective, highly scalable lakehouse.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ## What advantages does it bring?
-- MAGIC Delta lake provides snapshot isolation which helps concurrent read/write operations and enables efficient insert, update, deletes, and rollback capabilities. It allows background file optimization through compaction and z-order partitioning achieving better performance improvements.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ## What does ACID mean? Why do we need it?
-- MAGIC ACID stands for:
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC - Atomicity
-- MAGIC - Consistency
-- MAGIC - Isolation
-- MAGIC - Durability
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC We need it to guarantee that transactions are successful.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ## What is it not?
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC Delta Lake is only an open format storage layer, nothing else.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ## On top of what format is it built?
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC It is built on open format storage.

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md 
-- MAGIC ### Create a Delta table Company 
-- MAGIC - Try to write the query without consulting documentation, SQL syntax is important for certification
-- MAGIC - Columns: name as as string, companyId as Int, income as Double
-- MAGIC - Is this table managed or unmanaged?
-- MAGIC - Why do we not need to specify format?
-- MAGIC - Where is the table physicali stored? What storage and database it use?
-- MAGIC - Make sure the cell creating the table can be run multiple times in a row

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC The table is managed by HIVE because I did not specify a path for the table to be saved in physically, therefore it is managed.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ### Managed Table
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC - Managed tables are Hive owned tables where the entire lifecycle of the tables' data are managed and controlled by Hive. External tables are tables where Hive has loose coupling with the data. 
-- MAGIC - All the write operations to the Managed tables are performed using Hive SQL commands.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ### Unmanaged Table
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC - Unmanaged tables will always specify a LOCATION during table creation; you can either register an existing directory of data files as a table or provide a path when a table is first defined.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC We don't need to specify format because it automatically stores it in the **Delta Lake**
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC The table is physically stored in DBFS
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC The storage is Delta Lake, and it uses the database located in the variable **`DA.paths.user_db`**

-- COMMAND ----------

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Company
(name STRING, companyId INT, income DOUBLE);
select * from Company

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC ### Insert into the table
-- MAGIC - Try to write the query without consulting documentation, SQL syntax is important for certification
-- MAGIC - What is a transaction? 
-- MAGIC - What does it mean commiting a transaction? 
-- MAGIC - Insert into the table 3 records in one transaction, values of the records you can make up
-- MAGIC - Insert into the table 2 records each one in a single transaction, values of the records you can make up
-- MAGIC - What happens if the job fails midway?

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC # Transactions
-- MAGIC - A database transaction delimits a set of database operations that are processed as a whole.
-- MAGIC - Database operations included inside a transaction are validated or canceled as a unique operation. The database server is in charge of data concurrency and data consistency .
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC # Commiting a Transaction
-- MAGIC It means that the transaction was done successfully and was applied to the database.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC # What happens if the job fails midway?
-- MAGIC Every change is discarded and the database stays unchanged.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC **Chances are it will not even run in the first place, as it will most likely throw an error before execution**

-- COMMAND ----------

INSERT INTO Company
VALUES
  ("name1", 1, 10.155),
  ("name2", 2, 15.2921),
  ("name3", 3, 24.2219)

-- COMMAND ----------

INSERT INTO Company VALUES("name4", 4, 212.222);
INSERT INTO Company VALUES("name5", 5, 1.112);

-- MAGIC ### Querying a Delta table
-- MAGIC - Try to write the query without consulting documentation, SQL syntax is important for certification
-- MAGIC - Query your delta table customers
-- MAGIC - How would you query it if it were in a different database?
-- MAGIC - How can you get older version of the table?
-- MAGIC - How does the versioning of delta tables work? What does it use? 
-- MAGIC - What does happen if someone is reading at the same time you are writing into the table? 
-- MAGIC - How are concurent reads handled? What are the limitations?

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC ***Instruction error: There is no table "customers". I have queried the table Company.***
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ### How would you query it if it were in a different database?
-- MAGIC I would first specify the database with the command **`USE {DATABASE_NAME}`**, then query it normally.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ### How to get older versions of the table?
-- MAGIC By using the command **`DESCRIBE HISTORY {table_name}`**
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ### How does the versioning of delta tables work? What does it use?
-- MAGIC - The transaction log for a Delta table contains protocol versioning information that supports Delta Lake evolution.
-- MAGIC - Delta Lake tracks minimum reader and writer versions separately.
-- MAGIC - Delta Lake guarantees backward compatibility. A higher protocol version of Delta Lake reader is always able to read data that was written by a lower protocol version.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ### What does happen if someone is reading at the same time you are writing into the table?
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC Because Delta Lake has ACID properties and concurrency control, this will happen:
-- MAGIC - Multiple writers across multiple clusters can simultaneously modify a table partition and see a consistent snapshot view of the table and there will be a serial order for these writes.
-- MAGIC - Readers continue to see a consistent snapshot view of the table that the Databricks job started with, even when a table is modified during a job.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ### How are concurent reads handled? What are the limitations?
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC Delta Lake uses optimistic concurrency control to provide transactional guarantees between writes. Under this mechanism, writes operate in three stages:
-- MAGIC - **Read**: Reads (if needed) the latest available version of the table to identify which files need to be modified (that is, rewritten).
-- MAGIC - **Write**: Stages all the changes by writing new data files.
-- MAGIC - **Validate & Commit**: Before committing the changes, checks whether the proposed changes conflict with any other changes that may have been concurrently committed since the snapshot that was read. If there are no conflicts, all the staged changes are committed as a new versioned snapshot, and the write operation succeeds. However, if there are conflicts, the write operation fails with a concurrent modification exception rather than corrupting the table as would happen with the write operation on a Parquet table.
